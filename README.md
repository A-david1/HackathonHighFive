# Hackathon Wild Code School x Fiverr
Team HighFive

## Context

Year 2021. Fiverr and Wild Code School partner together to challenge students on a 3-day hackathon. 
Fiverr is looking for creative ideas to improve the community user-experience of freelancers on the platform.

## Realization

Landing on the Fiverr platform as a new freelancer can get a bit overwhelming. Would it not be great to be accompany on this journey by a mentor that has been selected just for you ?
That's what the new landing experience we designed was aiming for.

After a quick funny survey on your developer habits and lifestyle, our cute robot coupled with Rubix Machine-learning data processing analyzes your answers and extract from the database the mentors that might share your value.
Bigger are the avatars floating around the Fiverr planet, higher are the chances that the mentor behind is a good pick for you.
